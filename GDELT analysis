# How Global News Attention Changes Over Time

This project analyses how global news attention shifts over time using the GDELT 2.0 Global Events dataset.  
The analysis focuses on changes in the composition of major event categories across months and presents the results through an explanatory stacked area visualisation.

## Dataset
- **Source:** GDELT 2.0 Global Events Database
- **Access:** Google BigQuery public dataset (`gdelt-bq.gdeltv2.events`)
- The dataset contains millions of machine-coded global news events with metadata such as event type, date, and sentiment.

## Methodology
- Monthly aggregation of global event data in Google BigQuery using SQL
- Selection of the six most frequent event root categories
- Remaining categories grouped into an “Other” category
- Data cleaning and processing in Google Colab
- Normalisation to monthly proportions to analyse composition over time

## Visualisation
- Stacked area chart showing monthly composition of global event categories
- Designed to highlight shifts in global news focus rather than raw event volume
- Built using Plotly for clarity and accessibility

## Tools and Technologies
- Google BigQuery
- Google Colab
- Python (pandas, numpy, plotly, kaleido)
- LaTeX (report preparation)

## Project Type
Academic data analysis and visualisation project

## Notes
- The workflow is reproducible using the provided SQL queries and notebook
- Large-scale aggregation is handled in the cloud due to dataset size
